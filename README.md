## Advent of Code 2019
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly advent calendar with coding puzzles. These are my solutions for 2019's puzzles! I'm uploading myself solving these puzzles over on [my YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJgbigg8xpeVXoTAhn4dDpXMY9-cvwTlB)

I've set up a few helper scripts to make AoC puzzles easier. reindeer.rb will accept a day and puzzle param, and run the algo from day_#.rb. wreath.rb will accept a day, puzzle, and input, and test day_#.rb on a particular input. Many of the puzzles are parsed in the same way, so nutcracker.rb will crack the code and parse inputs in standard formats. My personal inputs are stored as day_#_input.txt.
